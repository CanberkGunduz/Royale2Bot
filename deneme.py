    Detects a red object within a specified screen area and simulates a key press when the object disappears (indicating it's time to 'get the fish').

    Parameters:
    - monitor_area: A dictionary with 'top', 'left', 'width', and 'height' keys defining the screen area to monitor.
    - lower_red_hsv: The lower bound of the HSV values to detect the red object.
    - upper_red_hsv: The upper bound of the HSV values to detect the red object.
    - detection_threshold: The threshold for detecting a significant change in red object presence.
    - key_to_press: The key to simulate pressing when the red object is detected to disappear.
